# Notebooks

This directory contains code for manipulating ICLab data as well as scraped data from various sources as specified in the repo README.

`ICLAB_Data_Cleaning_and_Analysis.ipynb` will walk you through all the steps needed to replicate our findings, including downloading data sources external to this repository.

The notebook is structured such that you can replicate any three parts of our work independently: (1) the data cleaning, (2) the metric generation and (3) the hypothesis testing.

Other files are documented in that notebook.
